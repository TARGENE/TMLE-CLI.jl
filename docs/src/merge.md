# Merging TMLE and SVP outputs

If multiple `scripts/tmle.jl` and potentially `scripts/sieve_variance.jl` have been run, you may want to combine the generated CSV outputs in a single result file. This is the purpose of this command line interface.

## Usage

You can merge summary CSV files by running:

```bash
julia scripts/merge_summaries.jl TMLE_PREFIX OUT --sieve-prefix=SIEVE_PREFIX
```

where:

- `TMLE_PREFIX`: is a prefix to all output CSV files generated by the `scripts/tmle.jl` script.
- `OUT`: is a path to the output file that will be generated.
- `--sieve-prefix`: is an optional prefix to the CSV output of the `scripts/sieve_variance.jl` script.

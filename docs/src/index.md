# TMLE-CLI.jl

The goal of this package, is to provide a standalone executable to run large scale Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation ([TMLE](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9782-1)) on tabular datasets. To learn more about TMLE, please visit [TMLE.jl](https://targene.github.io/TMLE.jl/stable/), the companion package.

We also provide extensions to the [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) universe that are particularly useful in statistical genetics (but not restricted to it):
